# Mermaid Editor

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/tomoyukim-vscode-extension/vscode-mermaid-editor-pipeline/_apis/build/status/tomoyukim.vscode-mermaid-editor?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/tomoyukim-vscode-extension/vscode-mermaid-editor-pipeline/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Mermaid Editor is VSCode extension inspired by [official mermaid live editor](https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) which provides mainly the following features:

- Live edit `mermaid.js` diagram file with [mermaid.js](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) diagram
- Generate image file from `mermaid.js` diagram file with preferred format (**png**, **jpg**, **webp** and **svg**).
- Copy image to clipboard directly.
- Customize configuration for individual `mermaid.js` diagram by using atrribute which is available in this extension.

Mermaid Editor does not contain syntax highlighting for Mermaid charting language.
But don't warry, a great plugin [Mermaid Markdown Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpruitt-goddard.mermaid-markdown-syntax-highlighting) works with Mermaid Editor.

Mermaid Editor is also available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tomoyukim/vscode-mermaid-editor) for developers who love FLOSS binaries of VSCode.

Mermaid Editor is implemented as 100% local solution mainly using mermaid.js and VSCode SDK.
It means Mermaid Editor does NOT require online environment and NOT send your code to any remote server in order to work.

Enjoy!
